## About Me

My name is Idara Nabuk, an Outreachy intern with OCaml with focus on the project "Improving the GUI experience for OCaml users". I have a passion for problem-solving and creating innovative solutions through code. 

Over the years, I've explored programming languages and frameworks such as C, Python, JavaScript and Tailwind via various training programs. I'm excited to land my first internship role at Outreachy and got to learn OCamI for the first time.

## Core Values

My core values are honesty, intergrity and leadership. 

### Honesty:
 I love being honest and so I love honest people too. It helps to guide my personality and relationship with others and also builds trust among friends and colleagues. 
### Integrity: 
With honesty comes integrity, and this value helps my professional life. It also shapes the way I go about my work and keeps me on track.
### Leadership: 
The first two core values of mine emboldens my leadership values. I love taking initiative and being goal oriented in other to achieve results together with others.

## My Journey

My journey into the world of software development started after my University degree. I studied Banking and Finance during my university degree and was looking forward to pursue a career in it. But after my first degree, I was introduced into the world of computer programming by my friend, and it was very interesting to me. 

The ability to create something from nothing with not more than a few lines of code fascinated me. Since then, I have dedicated myself to learning and growing in this field.

I started off with learning the basic markup language, HTML5, to CSS3, and moved to javascript. I also explored tailwindcss and its interesting stylings. Meanwhile I was still working with some CMS frameworks like drupal and wordpress. 

It wasn't really easy as I kept getting some discouragements as to how difficult computer programming is, but I'm glad I didn't give up and today I'm learning and contributing to an entirely new language to me but very interesting.

## My Motivation

All of my journey were self-paced learning and trying to develop myself and I never got to work on projects that are used by people in reality. I had heard about open source before and didn't really know how to go about it. 

When I learned about Outreachy, I was both excited about such opportunity and anxious about being able to get in. I was motivated by the fact that if I get to make it to the program, I'll be proving a point about not giving up on your dreams and aspirations. 

I will also be taking on real-life projects that will be used by people, hence, contributing and helping to solve problems with my skills for the first time, and above all I'll be paid for doing so. This was going to be a dream come true for me and I'm glad I got in and it is indeed a dream come true. 

## My Role at OCaml

As an Outreachy intern with OCaml, I will be working on improving the GUI (Graphical User Interface) experience for OCaml users. I will be contributing to building and improving the various libraries and frameworks in OCaml. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work with experienced professionals who can provide guidance and mentorship.

## What I Hope to Achieve

During my internship, I hope to gain hands-on experience in software development especially in OCaml and learn about the practical applications of the theoretical concepts I have been learning on my own. I am eager to learn from my mentors and contribute my very best to the growth of the organization and help achieve their goals. I also hope to improve my skills in teamwork, communication, and project management.

## Conclusion

I am thrilled and super excited to start this new chapter in my career at OCaml. I look forward to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. I am confident that this experience will be incredibly beneficial for my personal and professional growth.
