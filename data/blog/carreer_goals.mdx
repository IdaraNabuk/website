## Introduction

As an intern who is halfway into my three-month internship journey with OCaml, I've found myself deeply engrossed in the language's powerful functional programming capabilities. With my internship coming to an end soon, I've been reflecting on my career goals and I'll be sharing them with you in this post.

## Goal 1: Deepening My Understanding

My first goal is to continue deepening my understanding of OCaml. I've learned a lot during my internship, and there's still more to learn. I plan to continue studying and practicing OCaml even after my internship ends.

## Goal 2: Staying Connected with the OCaml Community

The OCaml community has been a great source of support, inspiration, and knowledge to me during my internship. I aim to stay connected with this community, participating in discussions, learning from others, and sharing my own experiences.

## Goal 3: Contributing to the OCaml Codebase

One of the most rewarding aspects of working with OCaml has been contributing to the codebase, specifically, the Bogue library that I've been working on. I plan to continue contributing even after my internship, helping to improve and expand the language.

## Goal 4: Advocacy and Teaching

I would also like to advocate for the OCaml language within my professional network and local community. I aim to teach OCaml to others by writing tutorials, organizing meetups, and giving talks.

## Goal 5: Securing a Paid Position

Finally, my ultimate goal is to secure a paid position or internship working with OCaml. I believe that the skills and experience I've gained during my internship have prepared me well for this, and I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. 

Securing a paid position in OCaml will also enable me to stay focused and committed to the language and community and continue contributing to it. With my internship ending in March 2024, I'm available to resume a paid position in April 2024

## Conclusion

As I approach the end of my internship, I'm excited about the challenges and opportunities ahead, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me. I'm more excited than ever about my future with OCaml. 

I'm grateful for the experiences I've had, the skills I've learned, and the community I've become a part of. I hope to continue a future with OCaml filled with code, community, and countless learning opportunities!
