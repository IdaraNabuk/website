Starting an internship is always a journey filled with excitement, anticipation, and a fair share of nervousness. When I embarked on my internship journey, I was thrilled to be working with OCaml, a powerful functional programming language known for its strong type inference and safety. However, as the saying goes, “Change is the only constant,” and this held true for my internship as well.

## The Initial Plan

At first, the initial timeline for my internship was meticulously planned. We had a clear roadmap, with each milestone carefully marked. The projects were inspiring, and challenging too. I was eager to dive into the world of OCaml, ready to contribute to the codebase, and excited to learn from the best in the industry.

The plan was to have me work on some libraries, one at a time, study the library, work on some examples in the library, and improve the documentation of those libraries. A beautiful plan isn't it?

## The Curveball

However, life often throws curveballs, and our best-laid plans can sometimes go awry. A month into my internship, we had to modify our timeline. The reasons were manifold - I needed more time to study and understand the language and libraries, and I also had unexpected technical challenges. Thanks to my mentors who always helped me out, though I would usually exhaust my options before running to them. It's how you learn as a software developer.

## Modifying Expectations

These led to our shifting of project priorities, and I learned more about the ever-evolving dynamics of the software industry. The change in plans helped me gain more focus, and I soon realized this was an opportunity in disguise. Instead of trying to do a little bit of everything in each library, I was advised to focus on the [Bogue library](https://github.com/sanette/bogue), create [more examples](https://github.com/IdaraNabuk/Bogue-examples), and develop the documentation there.

Modifying expectations did not mean lowering them; it meant adapting to new circumstances and finding ways to excel within them. I learned that in the tech industry, agility is key. The ability to adapt to changes, pivot when necessary, and maintain a positive attitude during times of uncertainty are crucial skills. I also realized that every challenge presents an opportunity to learn and grow.

## Lessons Learned

Looking back, the experience of modifying expectations has been enlightening. It taught me the importance of flexibility, resilience, and a growth mindset. It reinforced the fact that in the tech world, change is inevitable. The ability to adapt and evolve is what sets successful individuals and organizations apart.

## Conclusion

My internship journey with OCaml has been a rollercoaster ride - filled with highs and lows, twists and turns, and plenty of learning opportunities. As I continue on this journey, I am confident that no matter what changes come my way, I am equipped to handle them and emerge stronger.

So here’s to modifying expectations, embracing change, and making the most of every opportunity that comes our way!
